# 1. PREPARE

Our Unit 4 Case Study: Hashtag Common Core is inspired by the work of
Jonathan Supovitz, Alan Daly, Miguel del Fresno and Christian Kolouch
who examined the intense debate surrounding the Common Core State
Standards education reform as it played out on Twitter. As noted on
their expansive and interactive website for the [#COMMONCORE
Project](https://www.hashtagcommoncore.com), the Common Core was a major
education policy initiative of the early 21st century. A primary aim of
the Common Core was to strengthen education systems across the United
States through a set of specific and challenging education standards.
Although these standards once enjoyed bipartisan support, we saw in our
previous case study how these standards have become a political punching
bag.

# 4. MODEL

As highlighted inÂ [Chapter 3 of Data Science in Education Using
R](https://datascienceineducation.com/c03.html), theÂ **Model**Â step of
the data science process entails "using statistical models, from simple
to complex, to understand trends and patterns in the data."

# 5. COMMUNICATE

In this case study, we focused on the literature guiding our analysis;
wrangling our data into a network object; examining basic network
centrality measures; and identifying groups and sentiment in tweets
about the CCSS curriculum standards.

In response to the following research questions driving this analysis,
write a 2-3 sentences summarizing our findings:

1.  Who are the main transmitters, transceivers, and transcenders in our
    Common Core Twitter network?

    -   

2.  What subgroups, or factions, existed in our network?

    -   

3.  Which actors in our network tended to be more opposed to the Common
    Core?

    -   

Finally, add 1-2 sentences in response to the following prompts:

1.  One important thing I took away from this unit about network network
    analysis:

    -   

2.  One thing about network analysis I want to learn more about:

    -
