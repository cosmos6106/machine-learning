# Agenda

1. Introductions (5 min.)
1. Overview of machine learning (20 min.)

---

# Goals for this topic area

### Over-arching goal:

*Get started with applying machine learning methods in R*  

### Specific aims are to learn about:

- a small but important set of core ideas about machine learning
- how these ideas are instantiated through the *tidymodels* R package

# Overview of Machine Learning (ML)

---

# Defining ML

- *Artificial Intelligence (AI)*
.footnote[
[1]  I feel super uncomfortable bringing AI into this, but perhaps it's useful just to be clear about terminology
]
: Simulating human intelligence through the use of computers
- *Machine learning (ML)*: A subset of AI focused on how computers acquire new information/knowledge

This definition leaves a lot of space for a range of approaches to ML

# One example from Josh's work

**Using Twitter users profile descriptions to predict whether or not they were teachers**

- Manually coded &gt; 500 profiles for whether they were teachers or non-teachers
- Trained a Support Vector Machine model (or algorithm) on _text features_ using 90% of the data
- For the remaining 10% of the data, we predicted whether or not someone was a teacher with an accuracy of 85%; `\(\kappa\)` = 0.612.
- Then used the trained classifier to predict whether or not 1000s of users were or were not teachers (and used these classifications in a multi-level model)

# Supervised &amp; unsupervised

## Supervised ML

- Requires coded data or data with a known outcome
- Uses coded/outcome data to train an algorithm
- Uses that algorithm to **predict the codes/outcomes for new data** (data not used during the training)
- Can take the form of a *classification* (predicting a dichotomous or categorical outcome) or a *regression* (predicting a continuous outcome)
- Algorithms include:
  - [Linear regression (really!)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
  - Logistic regression
  - Decision tree
  - Support Vector Machine

---

# What kind of coded data?

&gt; Want to detect spam? Get samples of spam messages. Want to forecast stocks? Find the price history. Want to find out user preferences? Parse their activities on Facebook (no, Mark, stop collecting it, enough!) (from [ML for Everyone](https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/))

In educational research:

- Assessment data (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09895-9))
- Data from log files ("trace data") (e.g., [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2013.837391?casa_token=-8Fm2KCFJ30AAAAA%3Altbc8Y8ci_z-uLJx4se9tgvru9mzm3yqCTFi12ndJ5uM6RDl5YJGG6_4KpUgIK5BYa_Ildeh2qogoQ))
- Open-ended written responses (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09889-7), [2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-020-09761-w))
- Achievement data (i.e., end-of-course grades) (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09888-8), [2](https://search.proquest.com/docview/2343734516?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true))

What else?
- Drawings/diagrammatic models
- Data collected for formative purposes (i.e., exit tickets)
- ???

# How is this different from regression?

The _aim_ is different, the algorithms and methods of estimation are not (or, are differences in degree, rather than in kind).

In a linear regression, our aim is to estimate parameters, such as `\(\beta_0\)` (intercept) and `\(\beta_1\)` (slope), and to make inferences about them that are not biased by our particular sample.

In an ML approach, we can use the same linear regression model, but with a goal other than making unbiased inferences about the `\(\beta\)` parameters:

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;center&gt;In supervised ML, our goal is to minimize the difference between a known `\(y\)` and our predictions, `\(\hat{y}\)`&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

---

# So, how is this really different?

This _predictive goal_ means that we can do things differently:

- Multicollinearity is not an issue because we do not care to make inferences about parameters
- Because interpreting specific parameters is less of an interest, we can use a great deal more predictors
- We focus not on `\(R^2\)` as a metric, but, instead, how accurately a _trained_ model can predict the values in _test_ data
- We can make our models very complex (but may wish to "regularize" coefficients that are small so that their values are near-zero or are zero):
  - Ridge models (can set parameters near to zero)
  - Lasso models (can set parameters to zero)
  - Elastic net models (can balance between ridge and lasso models)

---

# Okay, _really_ complex

- Okay, _really_ complex:
  - Neural networks
  - Deep networks
- And, some models can take a different form than familiar regressions:
  - *k*-nearest neighbors
  - Decision trees (and their extensions of bagged and random forests)
- Last, the modeling process can look different:
  - Ensemble models that combine or improve on ("boosting") the predictions of individual models

---

# A helpful frame 

## Unsupervised ML

- Does not require coded data; one way to think about unsupervised ML is that its purpose is to discover codes/labels
- Is used to discover groups among observations/cases or to summarize across variables
- Can be used in an _exploratory mode_ (see [Nelson, 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0049124118769114?casa_token=EV5XH31qbyAAAAAA%3AFg09JQ1XHOOzlxYT2SSJ06vZv0jG-s4Qfz8oDIQwh2jrZ-jrHNr7xZYL2FwnZtZiokhPalvV1RL2Bw)) 
- **Warning**: The results of unsupervised ML _cannot_ directly be used to provide codes/outcomes for supervised ML techniques 
- Can work with both continuous and dichotomous or categorical variables
- Algorithms include:
  - Cluster analysis
  - [Principle Components Analysis (really!)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
  - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (topic modeling)

---

# What technique should I choose?

Do you have coded data or data with a known outcome -- let's say about K-12 students -- and, do you want to:

- _Predict_ how other students with similar data (but without a known outcome) perform?
- _Scale_ coding that you have done for a sample of data to a larger sample?
- _Provide timely or instantaneous feedback_, like in many learning analytics systems?

&lt;bold&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;center&gt;Supervised methods may be your best bet&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/bold&gt;

---

# What technique should I choose?

Do you not yet have codes/outcomes -- and do you want to?

- _Achieve a starting point_ for qualitative coding, perhaps in a ["computational grounded theory"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0049124117729703) mode?
- _Discover groups or patterns in your data_ that may be of interest?
- _Reduce the number of variables in your dataset_ to a smaller, but perhaps nearly as explanatory/predictive - set of variables?

&lt;bold&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;center&gt;Unsupervised methods may be helpful&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/bold&gt;

---

# What will I learn in this topic area?

You'll have the chance to learn about both _supervised_ and _unsupervised_ machine learning methods.

You'll use three different data sets while doing so. 

We'll work to answer these four questions:

- Can we predict something we would have coded by hand?
- How much do new predictors improve the prediction quality?
- How much of a difference does a more complex model make?
- What if we do not have training data?

# Machine Learning Learning Lab 1: Focusing on prediction

- Motivation: We want to train a computer to learn and reproduce coding we carried out
- Data: #NGSSchat data on transactional and substantive conversations
- Skills: Understanding how prediction differs from explanation; splitting data into a train and test set

---

# Machine Learning Learning Lab 2: Feature engineering

- Motivation: After training our computer, we realized we want to change our model
- Data: Survey, trace, and discussion data from online classes
- Skills: Feature engineering, resampling and cross-validation

---

# Machine Learning Learning Lab 3: Fine-tuning the model

- Motivation: We want to see whether a more complex model performs better
- Data: #NGSSchat data on transactional and substantive conversations
- Skills: Changing models (algorithms), determining the best tuning parameters

---

# Machine Learning Learning Lab 4: Finding groups (or codes) in data

- Motivation: We have complex trace data, but we don't have any codes (yet)
- Data: ASSISTments data 
- Skills: estimating latent profiles, computational grounded theory
