# Purpose and Agenda

Machine learning is increasingly prevalent in our lives---and in educational contexts. Its role in educational research and practice is growing, albeit with some challenges and even controversy. These learning labs are designed to familiarize you with machine learning and its applications in STEM education research. Throughout the module, we'll explore four key questions that correspond to the focus of each of the four learning labs. By the end, you will have a deep understanding of the key characteristics of machine learning and how to implement machine learning workflows in R and Python.

# Discussion 1

- Why are you interested in machine learning?

# Key Concept: Machine learning

# One example of ML . . .

```

*Builds upon supervised machine learning models--namely, deep neural networks, the likes of which can be estimated within R; the big advance has to do with the transformer architecture that allows for the fitting of more complex models. It is still important (maybe necessary) to learn about the foundational techniques and methodologies underlying GPT-4.*

# Overview of Machine Learning (ML)

---

# Defining ML

- *Artificial Intelligence (AI)* (i.e., [GPT-4](https://openai.com/api/))
: Simulating human intelligence through the use of computers
- *Machine learning (ML)*: A subset of AI focused on how computers acquire new information/knowledge

This definition leaves a lot of space for a range of approaches to ML

---

# Supervised & unsupervised

## Supervised ML

- Requires coded data or data with a known outcome
- Uses coded/outcome data to train an algorithm
- Uses that algorithm to **predict the codes/outcomes for new data** (data not used during the training)
- Can take the form of a *classification* (predicting a dichotomous or categorical outcome) or a *regression* (predicting a continuous outcome)
- Algorithms include:
  - [Linear regression (really!)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
  - Logistic regression
  - Random forest
  - Neural network

---

# What kind of coded data?

> Want to detect spam? Get samples of spam messages. Want to forecast stocks? Find the price history. Want to find out user preferences? Parse their activities on Facebook (no, Mark, stop collecting it, enough!) (from [ML for Everyone](https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/))

In educational research:

- Assessment data (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09895-9))
- Data from log files ("trace data") (e.g., [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2013.837391?casa_token=-8Fm2KCFJ30AAAAA%3Altbc8Y8ci_z-uLJx4se9tgvru9mzm3yqCTFi12ndJ5uM6RDl5YJGG6_4KpUgIK5BYa_Ildeh2qogoQ))
- Open-ended written responses (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09889-7), [2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-020-09761-w))
- Achievement data (i.e., end-of-course grades) (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09888-8), [2](https://search.proquest.com/docview/2343734516?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true))

# How is this different from regression?

The _aim_ is different, the algorithms and methods of estimation are not (or, are differences in degree, rather than in kind).

In a linear regression, our aim is to estimate parameters, such as $\beta_0$ (intercept) and $\beta_1$ (slope), and to make inferences about them that are not biased by our particular sample.

In an ML approach, we can use the same linear regression model, but with a goal other than making unbiased inferences about the $\beta$ parameters:

<h4><center>In supervised ML, our goal is to minimize the difference between a known $y$ and our predictions, $\hat{y}$</center></h3>

---

# So, how is this really different?

This _predictive goal_ means that we can do things differently:

- Multicollinearity is not an issue because we do not care to make inferences about parameters
- Because interpreting specific parameters is less of an interest, we can use a great deal more predictors
- We focus on how accurately a _trained_ model can predict the values in _test_ data
- We can make our models very complex!

---

# Okay, _really_ complex

- Neutral/deep networks
  - i.e., GPT-3 (175 B parameters), GPT-4 (>1 T parameters)
- And, some models can take a different form than familiar regressions:
  - *k*-nearest neighbors
  - Decision trees (and their extensions of bagged and random forests)
- Last, the modeling process can look different:
  - Ensemble models that combine or improve on ("boosting") the predictions of individual models

# Key Concept: SML vs. inferential modeling

---

## Unsupervised ML

- Does not require coded data; one way to think about unsupervised ML is that its purpose is to discover codes/labels
- Can be used in an _exploratory mode_ (see [Nelson, 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0049124118769114?casa_token=EV5XH31qbyAAAAAA%3AFg09JQ1XHOOzlxYT2SSJ06vZv0jG-s4Qfz8oDIQwh2jrZ-jrHNr7xZYL2FwnZtZiokhPalvV1RL2Bw)) 
- **Warning**: The results of unsupervised ML _cannot_ directly be used to provide codes/outcomes for supervised ML techniques 
- Algorithms include:
  - Cluster analysis and Latent Profile Analysis
  - [Principle Components Analysis (really!)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)

---

# What technique should I choose?

Do you have coded data or data with a known outcome -- let's say about K-12 students -- and, do you want to:

- _Predict_ how other students with similar data (but without a known outcome) perform?
- _Scale_ coding that you have done for a sample of data to a larger sample?
- _Provide timely or instantaneous feedback_, like in many learning analytics systems?

**Supervised methods may be your best bet**

---

# What technique should I choose?

Do you not yet have codes/outcomes -- and do you want to?

- _Achieve a starting point_ for qualitative coding, perhaps in a ["computational grounded theory"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0049124117729703) mode?
- _Discover groups or patterns in your data_ that may be of interest?
- _Reduce the number of variables in your dataset_ to a smaller, but perhaps nearly as explanatory/predictive - set of variables?

**Unsupervised methods may be helpful**

---

# What technique should I choose?

Do you want to say something about one or several variables' relations with an outcome?

- Understand whether an intervention was effective
- See how one or more variables relates to an outcome

**Traditional inferential statistics may be best**

# Learning Labs!

.panel[.panel-name[LL 1]

**SML Learning Lab 1: Foundations**
 
How is prediction different from explanation? This lab provides a gentle introduction to supervised machine learning by drawing out similarities to and differences from a regression modeling approach. The case study will involve modeling the graduation rate across 1000s of higher education institutions in the United States using data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).

]

.panel[.panel-name[LL 2]

**SML Learning Lab 2: Workflows With Training and Testing Data**

Building on the foundations from Lab 1, this session delves deeper into the workflows we will use when we are using a SML approach. Particularly, we'll explore the roles of training and testing data and when to use them in a SML workflow. We'll predict students' withdrawal from a course using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD).

]

.panel[.panel-name[LL 3]

**SML Learning Lab 3: Interpreting SML Metrics**

How is the interpretation of SML models different from more familiar models? In this lab, we'll explore and work to understand the confusion matrix that can and the various metrics (e.g., precision, recall, PPV, NPV, F-score, and AUC) that are used to interpret how good at making dichotomous predictions SML models are. We'll again use the OULAD, augmenting the variables we used in Lab 1, and we'll introduce a more complex model---the random forest model---as an alternative to the regression models used in previous labs.

]

.panel[.panel-name[LL 4]

**SML Learning Lab 4: Improving Predictions Through Feature Engineering**
 
How can we improve our predictions? This lab introduces the concept of feature engineering to enhance model performance. We'll explore techniques for creating new variables and refining existing ones to improve prediction accuracy. We also explore cross-validation to revise and refine our model without biasing its predictions. We'll work with the finest-grained OULAD data—interaction data—to demonstrate key feature engineering steps.
