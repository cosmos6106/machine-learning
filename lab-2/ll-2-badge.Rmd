![](img/ML_interpretation_Hx.jpg){width="30%"} \# need to create this one

As a reminder, to earn a badge for these learning labs, you will have to respond to a set of prompts for several parts:

-   In *Part I*, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts

-   In *Part II*, you will create a data product in R that demonstrates your ability to apply an analytic technique introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Data Product

For the data product, you will interpret a different type of model -- a model in a *regression* mode.

So far, we have specified and interpreted a *classification* model: one predicting a dichotomous outcome (i.e., whether students have withdrawn from a course). In many cases, however, we are interested in predicting a continuous outcome (e.g., students' number of points in a course or their score on a final exam).

While many parts of the machine learning process are the same for a regression machine learning model, one key part that is relevant to this learning lab is different: their interpretation. The confusion matrix we created to parse the predictive strength of our classification model [does not pertain]{.underline} to regression machine learning models. Different metrics are used. For this badge activity, you will specify and interpret a regression machine learning model.

The requirements are as follows:

-   Change your outcome to **students' final exam performance**.

-   Using the same data (and testing and training data sets), recipe, and workflow as you used in the case study, **change the mode** of your model from classification to regression and change the **engine** from a glm to an lm model.

-   **Interpret your regression machine learning model** in terms of three regression machine learning model metrics: **MAE**, **MSE**, and **RMSE**. Read about these metrics [here](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/process.html#model-eval). Similar to how we interpreted the classification machine learning metrics, focus on the substantive meaning of these statistics.

Please use the code chunk below for your code:

```{r}

```

Please add your interpretations here:

-   MAE:

-   MSE:

-   RMSE:

### Part II: Reflect and Plan

1.  What is an example of an outcome related to your research interests that could be modeled using a *classification* machine learning model?

-   

3.  What is an example of an outcome related to your research interests that could be modeled using a *regression* machine learning model?

-   

3.  Look back to the study you identified for the first machine learning learning lab badge activity. Was the outcome one that is modeled using a classification or a regression machine learning model? Identify which mode(s) the authors of that paper used and briefly discuss the appropriateness of their decision.

### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Prediction badge! Complete the following steps to submit your work for review:

1.  Change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML header](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/yaml-header.html) at the very top of this document to your name. As noted in [Reproducible Research in R](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/index.html), The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Click the yarn icon above to "knit" your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.

3.  Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.

4.  Publish your HTML page the web using one of the following [publishing methods](https://rpubs.com/cathydatascience/518692):

    -   Publish on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com) by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane when you knit your document. Note, you will need to quickly create a RPubs account.

    -   Publishing on GitHub using either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or the [HTML previewer](http://htmlpreview.github.io).

5.  Post a new discussion on GitHub to our [ML badges forum](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/machine-learning/discussions/2). In your post, include a link to your published web page and a short reflection highlighting one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you'd like to explore further.
