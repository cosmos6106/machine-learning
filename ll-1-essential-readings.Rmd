*This paper presents the qualitative coding of a large number of tweets
to the #NGSSchat (organized around threads). As you read this work,
question what opportunities and challenges might result from scaling up
the qualitative codes of transactional and substantive conversations.*

> The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) chat (#NGSSchat) is a
> social media-based professional network used to discuss topics related
> to the NGSS in the United States. While successful reforms involve and
> coordinate the work of multiple stakeholders, recent research points
> out a striking lack of coordination between the individuals working in
> different educational roles---to the detriment of intended changes in
> the system. In this study, we analyzed more than 7,000 posts from
> individuals participating in #NGSSchat on Twitter (n = 247) during
> 2 years of 1-hr synchronous discussions. We studied the depth and
> types of conversations that took place, the extent to which the
> involvement of teachers, administrators, researchers, and
> organizations was balanced, and what explains participation in the
> network over time. Using a mixed-methods approach involving social
> network analysis, we found that conversations were primarily
> transactional, or social, and substantive, or providing opportunities
> for sense-making about the standards or for participants to transform
> their practice and that individuals from diverse roles participated,
> with teachers comprising the plurality of those involved.
> Additionally, researchers, administrators, and teachers were the most
> active in the network, with no differences in both initiating, or
> sending, and being the recipients of, or receiving, replies as a part
> of conversations. Finally, we found that being a teacher or
> administrator, as well as receiving replies from individuals who were
> important in the network, were positively related to sustained
> involvement in the network in the following year. We discuss how
> #NGSSchat---as a social media-based professional
> network---demonstrates similar features in other effective networks,
> and how social media-based networks invite new visions for how to
> implement ambitious, large-scale changes in science education.

> Social media represent an increasingly important vehicle for informal
> professional development amongst teachers, and provide an illuminating
> means of tracing their collective knowledge building. The study
> reported here examines six large Facebook groups, created by and for
> teachers in Sweden, to exchange information about the teaching of
> mathematics and Swedish. Analysis establishes that professional
> knowledge was made available in 86% of discussion threads, most
> commonly relating to Shulman's categories of Knowledge of Learners,
> Curricular Knowledge, and Pedagogical Content Knowledge. Participants
> acknowledged opportunities for professional learning in 88% of such
> threads, and showed new understanding in 11%, particularly in longer
> threads.
