# Machine Learning (ML) Module

Machine learning is used in overt and covert ways throughout our lives, including in the educational contexts with which we are involved. Indeed, machine learning has a growing - but questionable - role in educational research and practice. What that role will be is up to us. In these learning labs, you will become familiar with machine learning and how it is used in educational contexts, especially for STEM education research. In particular, we'll explore four questions throughout this module:

- Learning Lab (LL) 1: Prediction: How is prediction different from explanation?
- LL 2: Interpretation: How do we interpret the accuracy of a machine learning model?
- LL 3: Feature Engineering: How can we improve our better?
- LL 4: Unsupervised methods: What if we do not have training data?

**Machine Learning Learning Lab 1: Prediction**

We have some data and want to develop a prediction model. Supervised machine learning is suited to this aim. In particular, in this learning lab, we explore how we can train a computer to predict students' withdrawal from a course. We use a large data set, the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), focusing on student data at this point. Our model at this point is relatively simple, a generalized linear model.

**Machine Learning Learning Lab 2: Interpretation**

How do we interpret a machine learning model? What else can we say, besides how accurate a model is? This learning lab is intended to help you to answer these questions by examining output from a classification and a regression model. We again use the OULAD, but add an assessment file.

**Machine Learning Learning Lab 3: Feature Engineering**

Once we have trained a computer in the context of using supervised machine learning methods, we may realize we can improve it by adding new variables or changing how the variables we are using were prepared. We also use a random forest model, rather than the regression model we have been using. Also, we consider key feature engineering steps with interaction data from the OULAD data set.

**Machine Learning Learning Lab 4: Unsupervised Methods**

The previous three learning labs involved the use of data with known outcome variables in the first three learning labs. Accordingly, we explored different aspects of supervised machine learning. What if we have data without something that we can consider to be a dependent variable? Unsupervised machine learning methods can be used in such cases. Herein, we use Latent Profile Analysis with quantified, transcribed audio data from mathematics classrooms. We interpret the output of Latent Profile Analysis from a Computational Grounded Theory approach.
