> The ability to regulate one's own learning is essential for success in online courses. Recent efforts have used clickstream data to create timely, fine-grained, and comprehensive measures of self-regulated learning (SRL) in online courses in an attempt to shed light on the process of SRL and to improve the identification of students who lack SRL skills and are at risk of low achievement. However, key questions remain: to what extent do these clickstream measures correspond to traditional self-reported measures about specific SRL constructs? Do these clickstream measures provide more information than existing self-reported measures in predicting course performance? This study used the clickstream data collected from a learning management system to measure two aspects of SRL: time management and effort regulation. We found that the clickstream measures were significantly associated with students' self-reported time management and effort regulation after the course. In addition, these clickstream measures significantly improved predictions of students' performance in the current and subsequent courses over predictions based on self-reported measures alone. These results provide evidence for the validity of the clickstream measures and guide the use of clickstream data to understand the process of SRL and identify students who might not be well served by taking classes online.

> Although online courses can provide students with a high-quality and flexible learning experience, one of the caveats is that they require high levels of self-regulation. This added hurdle may have negative consequences for first-generation college students. In order to better understand and support students’ self-regulated learning, we examined a fully online Chemistry course with high enrollment (N = 312) and a high percentage of first-generation college students (65.70%). Using students’ lecture video clickstream data, we created two indicators of self-regulated learning: lecture video completion and time management. Performing a k-means clustering on these indicators uncovered four distinct self-regulated learning patterns: (1) Early Planning, (2) Planning, (3) Procrastination, and (4) Low Engagement. Early Planning behaviors were especially important for course success—they consistently predicted higher final course grades, even after controlling for important demographic variables. Interestingly, first-generation college students classified as Early Planners achieved at similar levels as their non-first-generation peers, but first-generation students in the Low Engagement group had the lowest average grades among students. Overall, our results show that self-regulation may be an important skill for determining first-generation students’ STEM achievement, and targeting these skills may serve as a useful way to support their specific learning needs.

> This paper reports the findings of a study that measured the ef- fectiveness of employing automatic text translation methods in automated classification of online discussion messages according to the categories of social and cognitive presences. Specifically, we examined the classification of 1,500 Portuguese and 1,747 English discussion messages using classifiers trained on the datasets be- fore and after the application of text translation. While the English model generated, with the original and translated texts, achieved results (accuracy and Cohen’s κ) similar to those of the previously reported studies, the translation to Portuguese led to a decrease in the performance. The indicates the general viability of the proposed approach when converting the text to English. Moreover, this study highlighted the importance of different features and resources, and the limitations of the resources for Portuguese as reasons of the results obtained.
