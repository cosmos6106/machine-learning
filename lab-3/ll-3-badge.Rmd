### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Please read this article and then answer then response to the following three questions.

> Baker, R. S., Esbenshade, L., Vitale, J., & Karumbaiah, S. (2023). Using Demographic Data as Predictor Variables: a Questionable Choice. Journal of Educational Data Mining, 15(2), 22-52.

Part A:

1.  In what ways could the inclusion of demographic variables as predictors potentially reinforce biases in predictive analytics within education?

2.  The authors argue that demographic variables should be used to validate fairness rather than as predictors within models. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of this approach?

3.  How could the limitations of categorization impact the use of demographic variables in predictive models?

Part B: Once again, use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies machine learning to an educational context aligned with your research interests. More specifically, please find an article in your field that utilizes in *feature engineering*

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   

2.  What is the data source used in the study?

    -   

3.  Why was feature engineering *useful* or even *necessary* in this study?

    -   

### Part II: Data Product

For this data product, please add a feature (or several features) *specific to one or more of the activity types* in the OULAD interactions data, and then add these features to your model and evaluate the accuracy. How did the accuracy appreciably change--if at all? Please copy all of your code in one or more code chunks below.

### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Prediction badge! Complete the following steps to submit your work for review:

1.  Change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML header](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/yaml-header.html) at the very top of this document to your name. As noted in [Reproducible Research in R](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/index.html), The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Click the yarn icon above to "knit" your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.

3.  Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.

4.  Publish your HTML page the web using one of the following [publishing methods](https://rpubs.com/cathydatascience/518692):

    -   Publish on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com) by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane when you knit your document. Note, you will need to quickly create a RPubs account.

    -   Publishing on GitHub using either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or the [HTML previewer](http://htmlpreview.github.io).

5.  Post a new discussion on GitHub to our [ML badges forum](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/machine-learning/discussions/2). In your post, include a link to your published web page and a short reflection highlighting one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you'd like to explore further.
