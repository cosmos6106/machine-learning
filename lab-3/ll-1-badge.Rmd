The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research.

To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts:

-   In Part I, you will extend our model by addding another variable.

-   In Part II, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

### Part I: Extending our model

```{r}
students

students %>% 
    select(date_registration)
```

### Part II: Reflect and Plan

Part A:

1.  How good was the machine learning model we developed in the guiding practice? Would you be comfortable using it to code more conversations? What if you read about someone using such a model as a reviewer of research? Please add your thoughts and reflections following the bullet point below.

-   

2.  How might the model be improved? Share any ideas you have at this time below:

-   

Part B: Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies machine learning to an educational context aligned with your research interests. More specifically, **locate a machine learning study that involves making predictions**.

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   

2.  What research questions were the authors of this study trying to address and why did they consider these questions important?

    -   

3.  What were the results of these analyses?

    -   
    
### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Prediction badge! Complete the following steps to submit your work for review:

1.  Change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML header](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/yaml-header.html) at the very top of this document to your name. As noted in [Reproducible Research in R](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/index.html), The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Click the yarn icon above to "knit" your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.

3.  Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.

4.  Publish your HTML page the web using one of the following [publishing methods](https://rpubs.com/cathydatascience/518692):

    -   Publish on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com) by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane when you knit your document. Note, you will need to quickly create a RPubs account.

    -   Publishing on GitHub using either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or the [HTML previewer](http://htmlpreview.github.io).

5.  Post a new discussion on GitHub to our [ML Badges forum](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/machine-learning/discussions/2). In your post, include a link to your published web page and a short reflection highlighting one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you'd like to explore further.
