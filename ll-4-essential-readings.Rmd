Salmeron-Majadas, S., Baker, R. S., Santos, O. C., & Boticario, J. G. (2018). A machine learning approach to leverage individual keyboard and mouse interaction behavior from multiple users in real-world learning scenarios. IEEE Access, 6, 39154-39179.

> There is strong evidence that emotions influence the learning process. For this reason, we explore the relevance of individual and general mouse and keyboard interaction patterns in real-world settings while learners perform free text tasks. To this end, we have modeled users' mouse movements and keystroke dynamics with data mining techniques, building on previous related research and extending it in terms of some critical modeling issues that may have an impact on detection results. Inspired by practice in affective computing where physiological sensors are used, we argue for the creation of an interaction baseline model, as a reference point in the way how learners interact with the keyboard and mouse. To make the proposed affective model feasible, we have adopted a simplified 2-D self-labeling approach for labeling the users' affective state. Our approach to affect detection improves results when there is a small amount of data instances available and does not require additional affect-oriented tasks from the learners. Specifically, learners are only asked to self-reflect their emotional state after finishing the tasks and immediately selecting two values in the affect scale. The approach we have followed aims to distill two types of interaction patterns: 1) within-subject patterns (from a single participant) and 2) between-subject patterns (across all participants). Doing this, we aim to combine both the approaches as modeling factors, thus taking advantage of individual and general interaction patterns to predict affect.

> The vast majority of research involving active learning pedagogies uses passive lecture methods as a baseline. We propose to move beyond such comparisons to understand the mechanisms that make different active learning styles unique. Here, we use COPUS observations to record student and instructor activities in six known styles of active learning in physics, and use latent profile analysis to classify these observations. Latent profile analysis using two profiles successfully groups COPUS profiles into interactive lecturelike and other. Five latent profiles successfully sorts observations into interactive lecturelike, Modeling Instruction, ISLE labs, context-rich problems labs, and recitationlike or discussionlike. This analysis serves as a proof of concept, and suggests instructional differences across pedagogies that can be further investigated using this method.

> Achievement goal research has grown increasingly complex with the number of proposed goal orientations that motivate students. As the number of proposed goal constructs proliferates, a variety of data analytic challenges have emerged, such as profiling students on different types of goal pursuit as well as evaluating the relationships of multiple goal pursuit with different educational outcomes. The purpose of the current article is to showcase the advantages of using latent profile analysis (LPA) over other traditional techniques (such as multiple regression and cluster analysis) when analyzing multidimensional data like achievement goals. Specifically, we review the advantages of LPA over traditional person- and variable-centered analyses and then provide a critical look at three different conceptualizations of goal orientation (2-, 3-, and 4-factor) using LPA.
